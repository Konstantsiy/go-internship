### Balanced Parentheses algorithm
This algorithm checks whether the passed string is a balanced sequence of parentheses {} [] (), i.e.
each of the open parentheses must be closed by the same type of parentheses in the correct order.

For example:

- [(]) - unbalanced
- {[{}] ()}- balanced
- (((1 + 2) * 3) - 4)/5 - balanced
